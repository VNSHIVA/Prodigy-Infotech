This repository contains a collection of projects I developed during my internship at Prodigy Infotech in the Cyber Security domain. Each project demonstrates different concepts and techniques in Cyber Security.

## Projects Overview

1. **Caesar Cipher**
   - A simple implementation of the Caesar cipher encryption technique.
   - **Technologies:** Python
   - **Usage:** Encrypt and decrypt messages with a specified shift value.

2. **Keylogger**
   - A basic keylogger that captures keystrokes and stores them in a file.
   - **Technologies:** Python
   - **Usage:** Used for educational purposes to understand how keyloggers work.

3. **Network Packet Analyzer**
   - A tool to capture and analyze network packets.
   - **Technologies:** Python, Scapy
   - **Usage:** Helps in monitoring network traffic and understanding packet structures.

4. **Password Strength Checker**
   - A tool to evaluate the strength of a password based on various criteria.
   - **Technologies:** Python
   - **Usage:** Provides feedback on password strength to promote better password practices.

5. **Pixel Manipulation**
   - A project that demonstrates basic image processing techniques by manipulating pixel data.
   - **Technologies:** Python, PIL (Pillow)
   - **Usage:** Understands how image data can be processed and altered.

This experience has been instrumental in enhancing my knowledge and skills in Cyber Security, and I am grateful for the opportunity to learn and grow in such a dynamic and essential domain.
