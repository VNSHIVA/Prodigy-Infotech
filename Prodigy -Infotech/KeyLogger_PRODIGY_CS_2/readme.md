# Task 4: Simple Keylogger

This Python program implements a basic keylogger that captures and logs keystrokes. Designed as an educational tool, it demonstrates how keylogging works while incorporating ethical considerations. User consent is required before running the program.

## Features

- **Key Logging**: Records every keystroke along with a timestamp.
- **Log File**: Saves the logged keystrokes to a specified file for later review.
- **User Consent**: Includes a disclaimer and requires user acceptance of the terms and conditions before use.
- **Duration Control**: Allows the user to specify how long the keylogger should run.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Program**: Execute the script to start the keylogger.
2. **Read and Accept Disclaimer**: Carefully read the disclaimer provided in the console and accept the terms and conditions to proceed.
3. **Specify Duration**: Enter the duration (in seconds) for which the keylogger should log keystrokes.
4. **Logging Keystrokes**: The program will capture and log keystrokes during the specified period.
5. **Review Log**: Once the duration ends, the log file containing the captured keystrokes will be saved, and its location will be displayed.
