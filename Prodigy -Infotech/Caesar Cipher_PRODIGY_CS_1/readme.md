# Caesar Cipher Program

This Python application implements the classic Caesar Cipher algorithm, enabling users to easily encrypt and decrypt messages by shifting characters. The program is designed for simplicity, guiding users through each step of the process.

## Key Features

- **Dual Functionality**: Supports both encryption and decryption of messages.
- **Interactive User Input**: Users can input their own messages and define the shift value for the cipher.

## How to Use

1. **Start the Program**: Run the script to launch the Caesar Cipher application.
2. **Choose an Option**: Select `'e'` to encrypt or `'d'` to decrypt a message.
3. **Input Your Message**: Type the message you want to process.
4. **Set the Shift Value**: Enter the numerical shift value for the cipher.
5. **View Your Result**: The program will display the resulting encrypted or decrypted message.
